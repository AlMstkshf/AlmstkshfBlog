# üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUES

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT: File Upload System Needs Cloud Storage**

### **Issue:**
The current file upload system uses `multer` with memory storage, which will NOT work in Netlify's serverless environment:

```typescript
// Current implementation in server/routes.ts (lines 40-54)
const multerStorage = multer.memoryStorage(); // ‚ùå Won't work in serverless
```

### **Impact:**
- File uploads will fail in production
- Downloads functionality will be broken
- Image uploads for articles will not work

### **Solutions (Choose One):**

#### **Option 1: Netlify Blob Storage (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install @netlify/blobs
```

#### **Option 2: Cloudinary (Free tier available)**
```bash
npm install cloudinary multer-storage-cloudinary
```

#### **Option 3: AWS S3 (Most scalable)**
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 multer-s3
```

### **Temporary Workaround:**
For immediate deployment, disable file upload routes or return appropriate error messages.

## üîß **OTHER DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS**

### **1. Database Connection Pooling**
- ‚úÖ Using NeonDB with connection pooling
- ‚úÖ Serverless-compatible configuration

### **2. Environment Variables**
- ‚úÖ All required variables documented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è JWT secrets need to be changed from defaults

### **3. Serverless Function Size**
- ‚úÖ Function built successfully (97.4kb)
- ‚úÖ Within Netlify limits

### **4. Static Asset Handling**
- ‚úÖ Configured in netlify.toml
- ‚úÖ Cache headers set properly

## üìã **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### **Before Deploying:**
- [ ] Fix file upload system (choose cloud storage solution)
- [ ] Update JWT secrets in environment variables
- [ ] Test all API endpoints locally
- [ ] Verify database migrations are applied

### **After Deploying:**
- [ ] Test all functionality
- [ ] Monitor serverless function logs
- [ ] Verify database operations work
- [ ] Test bilingual functionality
- [ ] Check performance metrics

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

1. **Deploy with file uploads disabled** (for testing other functionality)
2. **Implement cloud storage solution** (recommended: Netlify Blobs)
3. **Update environment variables** with secure JWT secrets
4. **Test thoroughly** before going live
